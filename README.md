A Go implementation of [BlueFever's chess engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGAfaepBco4&list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg) 
with additional modifications and improvements such as a primitive king safety evaluation. 
The repo is currently missing some local libraries that I have used in the engine's implementation (input-utils, string-utils, math-utils).
